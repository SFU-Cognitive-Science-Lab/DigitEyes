A study of visuo-spatial information sampling beyond the eyes

These are the data and materials to recreate analyses for our forthcoming paper. We'll include citation information when we have it, and ask you to please cite our work if you use it. 

## Overview
We analyse the data from 3307 StarCraft 2 players. In the game, players move their screen around to gather information, much like how we move our eyes around to gather information from our everyday environment. 

We have a collection of measures to capture properties of visuo-spatial information sampling in the game, and find convincing parallels between the players' screen movements and what we already know about eye movements.
