** overview ** 

The analyses folder of DigitEyes contains the scripts required to recreate our analyses for the DigitEyes paper. 

You'll notice that the analysis scripts use a self-referential strategy to obtain the data that they call. They determine which directory they're in and then call data from the ../data/ directory to plot and perform analyses. As such, please do download the whole DigitEyes repository to recreate our analyses.
